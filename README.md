## Description

Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. The purpose of this application is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

## User Story

- I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
- SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly


## Acceptance Criteria

- WHEN I search for a city

- WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
- THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
